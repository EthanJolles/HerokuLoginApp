# SocialNetwork

I think Im done adding functionality, and depending on when you're looking at this it may no longer be functional as it's hooked up to my internship demo database that I am not hosting myself. 

Functionality includes creation of new accounts, logging in with accounts, status messages that show you if you had a successful account creation or login, as well as an overall user count.

Technologies used in this project include Java, HTML, Springboot, Thymeleaf, MySQL, JDBC, and Heroku.
